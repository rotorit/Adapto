A bit of a radical revamp of the Adapto Z Axis.
The reason for this revamp is mainly to improve Z Wobble (Z Ribbing, Z Banding Etc).

IMPORTANT: The top cross piece of your printer needs to be longer by approximately 100mm to fit the new Z Axis Motor Mounts.

1.) These parts replace the 5mm threaded rod with 8mm lead screw for the Z axis drive.
2.) It has been adapted from my previous versions of the 10mm smooth rod parts.
3.) I have added support material where needed to save having to turn supports on in your slicer, (I've found that Slic3r goes a bit extreme with support material or not enough).
4.) Added 608ZZ bearing supports for either end of the lead screw.
5.) Made X Axis Motor end mount more robust as mine kept bending upward due to the belt tension.
